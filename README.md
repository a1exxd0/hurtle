# CS141 Coursework 2 2024: Hurtle: The Haskell Logo Turtle
A language for drawing cool polygon art.

# Language rules
Specifying in more detail some syntactical rules:
 - Commas are treated as newlines
 - A HogoCode is a command that changes the active state of the program, i.e.
    - A movement or rotation (forward, back, right, left, home)
    - Pen command (setwidth, setcolor, penup, pendown, clearscreen)
    - Making a variable (make "<varname> <variable>)
    - Control flow calls:
        - Repeat: repeat \<count> [ \<listofcode> ]
        - For : for [\<counter> \<start> \<end> \<step>] [ \<listofcode> ]
        - Procedure calls : \<procname> \<args>
 - Multiple spaces and multiple newlines are parsed as a single space
 - HogoCode elements must end in a newline
 - Procedure declarations are not HogoCodes, they enclose HogoPrograms and only access what's in their scope
 - They are declared as: "to \<procname> :\<arg1> :\<arg2> [ \<listofcode> ] end" with an arbirary number of parameters.
 - Code is case-insensitive
 - A variable can be a float or a reference to another variable, or an operation performed on multiple variables
 - To use a variable, we can say for example: forward :\<varname>
 - We can perform arithmetic via keywords (sum, multiply, divide, difference)
 - In the fashion: \<opname> \<var1> \<var2>

## Example function and program
```
; where s, l, r, n, g, rp
to bam :s :l :r :n :g :rp [

    make "col 1 ;make a variable col the value 1

    repeat :rp [                    ; repeat this rp times
        make "col sum :col 1        ; add 1 to the value of col
        setcolor :col               ; set the color [truncates the value in interpretation for type safety]
        setwidth multiply :col 1.01 ; set the width and expand slowly
        right :r                    ; rotate right by parameter
        repeat :s [                 ; repeat s times by parameter
            forward :l              ; move forward l by param
            right div 360 :s        ; go right by 360 div param
        ]                           ; scope repeat close
        make "l sum :l :n           ; make l the sum of 2 params
        right :r                    ; go right by param
        make "s sum :s :g           ; make s the sum of 2 params
    ] 

] end

bam 5 100 3 5 0 420
```

# Fail cases
The program isn't perfect (and neither is Logo Turtle, this mimics that in a sense)
 - If you write a program that won't terminate, the code is guaranteed to never run.
 - The compiler relies on knowing exactly how many calls are made as loops are replaced with the code equivalent; i.e. writing repeat 2 \<code> will replace that HogoCode with \<code> \<code>. A similar process is applied to for loops
 - The conditional for loop is not affected by change of variable inside of the loop, i.e. if you set step to 1 and add 1 to the counter variable inside of the loop, it won't loop fewer times.
